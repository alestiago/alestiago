#### ðŸ‘‹ About me

I am a thoughtful developer, who enjoys the thrill of challenging new projects and finding creative, clean and efficient solutions. I also love lemurs.

#### ðŸ’» What am I working on?

Currently, I am a second year Computer Science (CS) student at Loughborough University and part of the core team at the University's Developer Student Club. 
I am learning CS concepts and working on various coursework projects.

I also enjoy coding in my free time, and I am currently developing some Flutter apps and websites with React.

#### ðŸ‘€ What are some of my projects?

Some of my public projects are:
- Chareditor ([chareditor.com](https://chareditor.com/)) - [Repository](https://github.com/alestiago/chareditor-dist)

- Tap. (Currently under Google Play internal testing)

I have also worked on many different projects for University, these include an Arduino Game, a Python Library System, a Java Stock System and many others. Most of the code for these projects are currently kept private to avoid possible academic issues.
